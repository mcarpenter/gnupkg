NAME
     gnupkg - create Solaris packages from GNUish sources


SYNOPSIS
     gnupkg -h
     gnupkg -v
     gnupkg [-b build_cmd] [-c configure_cmd] [-d]
            [-i install_cmd] [-p pkg_options] [-s] source


DESCRIPTION
     gnupkg is a script to automate the creation of Solaris pack-
     ages  or  package  streams from source distributions. gnupkg
     assumes the use of a standard  GNU  autoconf  "configure  &&
     make  &&  make  install" setup (although each of those steps
     can be overriden with the -c (configure), -b (build)  or  -i
     (install)  flags  respectively). Compound commands should be
     specified as a string with && separators so  early  exit  on
     error  is guaranteed.  If the configure or build step should
     be omitted then pass a colon (:)  to the appropriate flag.


     The source may either be a source directory or a tarball  of
     the  form  .tar,  .tgz, .tar.gz or .tar.bz2. If the supplied
     filename looks like an URL then the tarball is  first  down-
     loaded  using  either wget or curl. Package name and version
     are extracted from the source name (assumes dash  separator)
     and may be overriden by command line options (see -p below).
     Similarly the package prefix (default: GNU), email (default:
     root), category (default:  application), etc may also all be
     overridden.


OPTIONS
     The following options are supported:


     -b build_cmd        Build command. The default is make.


     -c configure_cmd    Configure command. The default is ./con-
                         figure --prefix=/usr/local.


     -d                  Debug mode: do not delete the  temporary
                         directories created in /tmp on exit.


     -h                  Print help on stdout and exit.

     -i install_cmd      Install command.  The  default  is  make
                         install.  The environment variable DEST-
                         DIR is set to beneath the base temporary
                         directory; explicitly unset this here if
                         you wish to install elsewhere.  See  GNU
                         Coding  Standards  for  a description of
                         DESTDIR.


     -p pkg_options      Set package options as a comma-separated
                         string of name=value pairs.  The follow-
                         ing package option names are supported:


          arch                Set the package platform  architec-
                              ture.  By default the value used is
                              derived from uname -p.   A  typical
                              use  is  to  set  this  to  all for
                              architecture-agnostic packages.


          category            Set  the  package   category.   The
                              default is utility. see pkginfo(4).


          email               Set the package email. The  default
                              is root. see pkginfo(4).


          name                Set the package name.  The  default
                              is   determined   from  the  source
                              filename.


          prefix              Set the package  prefix,  which  is
                              typically  a stock ticker symbol or
                              author's initials or  similar  (eg.
                              SUNW). The default is GNU.


          vendor              Set the  package  vendor.  This  is
                              typically  a  URL.  The  default is
                              http://gnu.org/.


          version             Set  the   package   version.   The
                              default   is  determined  from  the
                              source filename.


     -s                  Create a package datastream (rather than
                         a directory structure).
